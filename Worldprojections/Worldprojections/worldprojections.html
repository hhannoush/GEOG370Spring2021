    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections.</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red"></h2>
    <p>Below are several examples of projections for a "flat" map of Earth. The images were made in QGIS, using the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to search for different types of projections. To show distortion, latitude and longitude lines are displayed as well as Indicatrix circles, which become more deformed as distortion increases. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Large vertical and horizontal distortion towards the poles. Latitute and longitude lines are straight, so relative direction is preseved, though not distances. </h3>

    <img src=".//maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Most distortion at maximum longitudes and latitudes, though the distortion is less than on the WGS84 projection. Has a more spherical shape, may preserve distance and area.</h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>Equal distortion in latitudes and longitudes, greatest at the poles. Area is not preserved. Latitute and longitude lines are straight, so relative direction is preseved. </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>Looks spherical, has distortion but not has severe as the Mercator map. Distortion is still greatest at the poles. The map looks like a compromise between area size, distance, and shape. </h3>

    <h2>Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>Large distortion at minimum latitudes. Area in the North Pole is most accurate.</h3>

    </a>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>Large distortion at minimum latitudes. Area, shape, and distance in the North Pole is most accurate.</h3>

    <img src="./maps/North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant_102016.png" alt="North Pole Azimuthal" width='500px'>
    </a>

    <h2>North Pole Orthographic Projection</h2>
    <h3>Does not show all land - it seems to only show the Northern hemisphere. Around the equator, distortion is so severe that the land below it cannot be seen. But above the equator, general shape and distance seem to be preserved. Maximum latitudes have the least distortion. </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Mollweide Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the Aitoff and Winkel projections. Equator and Prime Meridian are straight lines and intersect and 90 degree angles. More accurate near the Equator and distorts towards the poles. Area seems to be preserved. </h3>
