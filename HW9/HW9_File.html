    <h1>Homework 9: Thematic Maps </h1>
    <h2>Heidi Hannoush</h2>
    <h3>This map shows the relationship between forest cover and forest fires in South American countries. Forest cover data is represented by a choropleth; the darker greens symbolize countries with higher percentages of forest cover based on their square mile size in 2020.</h3>
    <h3>Forest fire data is shown with proportional symbols and was calculated as 2020 forest fire occurance per square mile of each country. The larger the flame symbol, the more forest fires occured in 2020 per square mile of a country</h3>
    <h3>I chose this topic because I was interested to see if countries with less forest cover would experience more forest fires.</h3>
    <h3>While there are other factors that could play a role in the number of forest fires besides tree cover, this map shows many countries with lower percentage forest cover do seem to have a greater number of fires.</h3>
